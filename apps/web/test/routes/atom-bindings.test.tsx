/**
 * Every page renders without a missing binding.
 *
 * This exists because of a real failure: `ReferenceError: onboardingAtom is not
 * defined`, thrown inside a page. Nothing caught it — `tsc` sees the import, the
 * production bundle resolves it, and no test rendered the page — so the first
 * report came from somebody clicking through to it.
 *
 * The pages are imported dynamically and mounted for real. A module whose imports
 * do not line up with its uses throws on evaluation or on first render, and either
 * way this fails. Data is not stubbed: the atoms cannot reach `/rpc` in the test DOM,
 * so each page renders its loading or failure branch — which is enough, because
 * what is under test is that the module and its bindings hold together.
