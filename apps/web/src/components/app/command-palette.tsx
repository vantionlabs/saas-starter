/**
 * ⌘K, over destinations and records.
 *
 * The two "go to" groups are built from the arrays that already drive the sidebar
 * and the settings nav, exported for exactly this reason — a hand-typed second
 * list is how a page ends up reachable from one and not the other.
 *
 * On `RULES.md`'s rule that navigation must use real links: a `CommandItem` is not
 * an anchor, so these call `navigate`. That is acceptable here because the palette
 * is a keyboard accelerator over destinations which all remain real `<Link>`s in
 * the sidebar — it is not the only route to any of them.
 *
 * Mounted inside the signed-in shell, not the root: a palette listing an
 * organization's contacts on the sign-in page would be a bug, not a feature.
