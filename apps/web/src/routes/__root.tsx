        Atoms are disposed the moment their last subscriber unmounts, unless the
        registry has an idle window — `AtomRegistry` only schedules a node for a
        timed removal when an idle TTL exists, and deletes it outright otherwise.
        With no window, every navigation threw away the page's data and refetched
        it on the way back, even when nothing had changed.

        Thirty seconds is the window, and it bounds how stale a returning page can
        be. That is proportionate: mutations from this tab invalidate their
        reactivity keys immediately regardless, so the only thing this can hold on
        to is a change somebody else made in the last half-minute.
