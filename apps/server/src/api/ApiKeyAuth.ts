/**
 * Turns an `Authorization: Bearer vantion_live_…` header into the same `Identity`
 * the session middleware produces.
 *
 * That sameness is the point. The public API reuses the RPC handlers, so it must
 * also reuse their `CurrentUser`, their policies and their org scoping — if API
 * traffic arrived with a different shape of caller, every `withPolicy` on every
 * handler would be a second code path nobody tested.
 *
 * A key has no user, so `userId` is the key's own id. Anything attributed to it
 * in the audit log therefore names the credential rather than a person, which is
 * the honest answer to "who did this".
