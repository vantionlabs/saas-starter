/**
 * Reads are declared by naming the RPC; writes stay hand-written.
 *
 * `AppRpc.query` builds the atom, so there is no service to yield and no effect
 * to write for a plain fetch. `AppRpc.mutation` exists too, but its reactivity
 * keys are supplied per *call* rather than per definition — which would scatter
 * "what does this invalidate" across every call site and make it something to
 * forget. Keeping writes as `runtime.fn` keeps that answer in one place, next to
 * the write it belongs to.
