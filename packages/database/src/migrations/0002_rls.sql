-- Row-level security, as defence in depth behind application-level org scoping.
--
-- `contact` is the first org-scoped application table and the carrier for the
-- policy; every later tenant table follows the same three statements.
--
-- FORCE is essential: without it Postgres exempts the table owner, which is the
-- role the application connects as, so the policy would never apply.
--
-- FORCE is still not enough on its own. Superusers, and any role holding
-- BYPASSRLS, ignore row-level security entirely. DATABASE_URL must therefore
-- point at an unprivileged role — `docker compose` provisions `vantion`, which is
-- not a superuser. Connecting as a superuser silently disables every policy
-- below while leaving `pg_class.relrowsecurity` reading true.
