/**
 * What a page shows when its own code throws.
 *
 * Without this, TanStack's default catch boundary renders the raw error into an
 * otherwise blank pane, which reads as the application being broken with no way
 * forward. In practice the commonest cause in development is a stale module
 * graph after a failed hot update — a full reload fixes it, and that is precisely
 * what somebody staring at the blank pane does not know.
 *
 * The message is deliberately not an apology and not a stack trace: it says what
 * to try, and leaves the detail in the console where it is actually readable.
