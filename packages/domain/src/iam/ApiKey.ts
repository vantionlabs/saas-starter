/**
 * A credential for calling the app without a browser session.
 *
 * Three decisions, all of them about what happens when a key leaks.
 *
 * It is **hashed** at rest. A key is a bearer credential, so a dump of this
 * table must not be a set of working keys — the same reason passwords are not
 * stored. SHA-256 without a salt is deliberate and sufficient here: the input is
 * 32 bytes of CSPRNG output, so there is no dictionary to attack and no
 * plausible rainbow table.
 *
 * It carries a **prefix in clear**, because a key that cannot be identified
 * cannot be revoked. When one turns up in a public repository the owner needs to
 * find it in a list, and comparing hashes by hand is not that.
 *
 * It is **scoped to a role**, not to a user. A key that inherited whoever
 * created it would silently gain capabilities when that person was promoted, and
 * keep them after they left.
