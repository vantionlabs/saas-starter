/**
 * Version 1 of the public HTTP API.
 *
 * ## Why this exists separately from the RPC group
 *
 * The RPC group is our own client's transport: ndjson, one path, tag-dispatched.
 * A fine internal contract and a poor public one — nobody integrates against a
 * bespoke envelope, and publishing it would freeze our internal wire format
 * forever. So the handlers are shared, through `ContactStore`, and the transport
 * is not.
 *
 * ## How versioning works
 *
 * The version is in the path, applied by `prefix` at the bottom. Path-based
 * because it is the one scheme that survives contact with `curl`, a browser
 * address bar and a customer's HTTP library — a version carried in a custom
 * `Accept` header is invisible in every log and every bug report.
 *
 * A v2 is a *sibling directory*, not an edit to this one. It gets its own frozen
 * `Wire` schemas and its own mapping from the domain, and this file keeps
 * compiling and serving unchanged. That is the point: adding v2 must not be able
 * to alter v1, and the only real guarantee of that is sharing no types.
